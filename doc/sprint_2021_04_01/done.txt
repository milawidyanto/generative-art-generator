Steps to put the model in production:
	- Addition of necessary columns
	- Migration to new keytab
	- Data checks created
		- Number of rows
		- avg, min, max, std, histogram of cpa_pred_mean
		- avg, min, max, std, histogram of bv_share_pred
		- avg, min, max, std, histogram of bv_share_inc_pct
		- avg, min, max, std, histogram of cpa_inc_pct
		- Scatter plots to show the predictions and last values
		- Amount of partner locales
		- Amount of partners
		- Amount of locales
		- Mean, min, max, std, barplot of the number of datapoints per partner-locale
		- Mean, min, max, std, barplot of the number of datapoints per partner
		- Mean, min, max, std, barplot of the number of datapoints per locale
		- Number of partner-locales, partners, locales with more than 2 data points
		- Position of the last cpa value:
		- Number inside the interval
		- Number outside the interval
		- Number at the left of the interval
		- Number at the right of the interval
		- Ratio inside the interval
		- Ratio outside the interval
		- Ratio at the left of the interval
		- Ratio at the right of the interval

	- Modifications to the system, that were checked with the data checks (one by one):
		- Some ti_export filters removed
		- Sample mechanism improved
		- Good partner locales filter removed
		- ti_export filters on inc values removed
		- Change in the calculation for inc values
		- Refactor of the calculation of the last month values for the predictions
		- Drop NaNs in preprocessing instead of filling with 0
		- Add a monotonically increasing filter
